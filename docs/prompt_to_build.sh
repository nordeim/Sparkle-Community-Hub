Now, put on your deep thinking hat to think deeply and thoroughly, to carefully and systematically review the `Project Architecture Document` below. Based on the deep and thorough understanding gained from the document, give me your assessment of the current architecture design and whether it correctly aligns with the project's PRD and README documents. pay particular close attention to study carefully the design of the database schema, and give your assessment of its design and its alignment with the project's PRD, README and PAD documents.

awesome review! please put on your deep thinking hat to deeply think and thoroughly explore carefully and systematically how to create a complete updated replacement for the `database_schema.sql` file within ```sql and ``` tags. use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully and systematically plan how to execute the creation of the complete updated replacement file, then proceed cautiously to create. use line by line "diff" comparison after generation so that you do not accidentally omit any existing features and functions in the original database schema file. thank you and good luck my very best coding assistant!
