     isVirtual Boolean
     virtualPlatform String?
     locationCoords Json?
   }
   ```

## üö® Minor Gaps & Recommendations

### 1. **Future Features Not Yet Modeled**
While these are planned for Year 2, consider adding placeholder tables:
- Blockchain/NFT integration tables
- AR/VR experience metadata
- Metaverse space definitions

### 2. **Performance Considerations**
```sql
-- Recommend adding these via migrations:
-- 1. Partitioning for high-volume tables
ALTER TABLE analytics_events PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);
ALTER TABLE activity_streams PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- 2. Materialized views for complex aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trending_posts AS ...
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_reputation_scores AS ...
```

### 3. **Additional Indexes Suggested**
```prisma
// Consider composite indexes for common queries
@@index([userId, createdAt, contentStatus]) // For user content feeds
@@index([categoryId, published, publishedAt]) // For category pages
```

### 4. **Schema Organization**
Consider splitting into multiple schema files for maintainability:
- `schema/user.prisma`
- `schema/content.prisma`
- `schema/gamification.prisma`
- `schema/realtime.prisma`

## üìà Scalability Assessment
